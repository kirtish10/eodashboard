## Water quality in New York

On March 22, New York state, at the time the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, set mandatory stay-at-home restrictions in an attempt to slow the spread. These restrictions are expected to dramatically alter the quantity and location of nutrient inputs to Long Island Sound. Data from the moderate-resolution imagers onboard the NASA Aqua, U.S. Geological Survey-NASA Landsat 8, and European Space Agency Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites reflect changes in Long Island Sound and New York Harbor water quality indicators (chlorophyll-a and sediment) following quarantine restrictions. 

**Chlorophyll-a** is an indicator for nutrient levels and algae growth; the amount of sediment in the water reflects how murky or clear it is. Anomalies presented here reflect highly variable physical and ecological dynamics of Long Island Sound, and potential effects from stay-at-home restrictions. More work is ongoing to assess the main factors driving these changes.

Human activity greatly influences water quality. Runoff from agriculture and cities can overload coastal waters with excess nutrients, ships in ports and other waterways can mix up sediment and increase turbidity, and even air pollution can end up in our water.

As lockdown restrictions were put into place around the world in response to the novel coronavirus, the immediate reduction in vehicle and ship traffic led to noticeable improvements in our air quality. Now, researchers are looking to see if those same benefits will be reflected in our water.

Scientists are examining whether the amount of algae (chlorophyll-a) and sediment (turbidity) in water bodies was affected by the shutdowns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, teasing out those signals from normal variations due to weather and economic changes is challenging.

Bluer colors indicate lower levels of chlorophyll-a and improved water quality. Image Credit: NASA.*

### Interpreting the data

Both chlorophyll-a concentrations and turbidity fluctuate naturally based on a variety of factors, including natural geography and the weather. For example, in coastal areas strongly influenced by river runoff and human activities, such as shipping and tourism, higher chlorophyll-a concentration can result from the discharge of urban sewage and fertilizers from agriculture over the watershed, which could counter any effects we may have seen due to the shutdowns.

Therefore, these data must be interpreted cautiously before drawing conclusions on how COVID-19 shutdowns may have affected water quality.
