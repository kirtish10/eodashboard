# Earth Observing Dashboard

### A Tri-Agency Dashboard by NASA, ESA, JAXA

International collaboration among space agencies is central to the success of satellite Earth observations and data analysis. These partnerships foster more comprehensive measurements, robust datasets, and cost-effective missions.

The tri-agency COVID-19 Dashboard is a concerted effort between the **European Space Agency (ESA)**, **Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)**, and **National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)**. The dashboard combines the resources, technical knowledge and expertise of the three partner agencies to strengthen our global understanding of the environmental and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Use the dashboard to explore environmental and economic indicators based on remote sensing data from ESA, JAXA and NASA, and investigate how social distancing measures and regional shelter-in-place guidelines have affected Earthâ€™s air, land, and water. Explore individual countries and regions across the world to see how the indicators in each specific location have changed over time.

Together, ESA, JAXA, and NASA will continue to update this dashboard with the most current information.
