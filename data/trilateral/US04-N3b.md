## Impact of COVID-19 on Water Quality

Chlorophyll-a concentration is an indicator of algae abundance which fluctuates naturally over space and time, as a result of combined atmospheric and oceanic effects (e.g., marine currents and upwelling). In coastal areas, strongly influenced by river inputs and human activities, high Chl concentration can result from the discharge of urban sewage, industrial runoffs, and fertilizers from agriculture activities over watersheds. In particular, nutrient inputs of anthropogenic origin affect the natural amount of phytoplankton in marine and inland waters, representing a continuous threat to biodiversity and leading to undesirable modifications of phytoplankton concentration (i.e., eutrophication).  

### Water Quality Time Series

The displayed time series show weekly **Chl concentration anomalies (%)** as calculated from **[NASA's MODIS Aqua satellite](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/aqua/)**  (<span style="color:#47a">blue</span>). 

On the indicator chart, for each day, the light/dark red chart background indicates whether there were **restrictions or lockdown** measure in place in the country where the city is located. This information is based on [Oxford Universityâ€™s coronavirus government response tracker](https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/).
