## San Francisco (USA) - Nightlights

The High Definition Nightlights dataset is processed to eliminate light sources
like moonlight reflectance and other interferences. The darker shades are places
with less light while the lighter shades of yellow are areas with more light.

A shelter-in-place mandate went into effect for six counties in the San Francisco metropolitan area on March 17, 2020, closing non-essential businesses and keeping approximately 6.7 million residents at home. The nightlights data, captured before and during the mandate, show an abrupt decrease in night lights predominantly in the central business districts, market areas, and entertainment districts that can be seen in the “before” and “after” imagery.

High-resolution nighttime images from space, referred to by NASA as the Black Marble HD dataset, provide data on how coronavirus-containment strategies have affected local businesses and neighborhoods. The nightlights sensor can decipher changes in urban business, industry, and transportation activity patterns associated with closures, event cancellations, and reduced vehicle traffic.
