## High-resolution population density maps

This data is provided by Facebook [Data For Good](https://dataforgood.fb.com)

The high-resolution maps estimate the number of people living within 30-meter grid tiles in nearly every country around the world.

Darker areas indicate higher population density areas and lighter areas indicate lower population density areas.
