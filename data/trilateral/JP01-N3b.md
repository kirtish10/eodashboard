## Water quality in Tokyo Bay

**Phytoplankton chlorophyll-a concentration** (Chl-a, mg/m3) can be derived from ocean colour satellite sensors. 

The **Chl-a anomaly** is the Chl-a difference from the reference climatological values and is expressed in %. It is used as an index to assess and monitor the potential effects of the lockdown, and subsequent recovery, on inland and coastal water quality. 

Chl-a is an indicator of phytoplankton abundance which fluctuates naturally with nutrient, solar irradiance, and water temperature, and so on. In coastal areas, Chl-a is commonly used as a proxy for water quality because it is strongly influenced by river runoff and human activities, such as the discharge of urban sewage and agriculture fertilizers.

### Tokyo Bay 

The Chl-a indicator images in **Tokyo Bay** are displayed as an example of the coastal water-quality changes near the Japanese biggest cities, Tokyo, Yokohama, and Kawasaki. 

Relatively large rivers, **Arakawa**, **Sumida**, **Edogawa**, and **Tama-River** are in north and west-side of the bay. The variation ranges of the Chl-a indicators in late of March to April 2020 were similar to the ones in other months, and it was sometimes more influenced by large river outflow (e.g., around the end of March and middle-late April in 2020). That may show there is no significant influence on the coastal environment and ecosystem, even though the indicators cannot detect ones smaller than several hundred-meter scales.

Another indicator, **Total Suspended Matter (TSM)** concentration, will be a help to understand the environmental changes, because the satellite Chl is sometimes influenced by other light-absorption components such as dissolved organic matter and the TSM shows more direct influence of the suspended-matter upwelling by the winds and the river outflow especially in the bay areas. 

Weekly anomaly of the TSM concentration map and time series are introduced in the dashboard. Similarly to the Chl, TSM did not show clear anomaly from late March to April 2020 except for some increase event due to the river outflow after the heavy rains. In the case of Tokyo Bay, the natural change seemed dominant for TSM rather than the low ship traffic.
