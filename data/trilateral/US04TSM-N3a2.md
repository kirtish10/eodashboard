## Water Quality in New York

Human activity greatly influences water quality. Runoff from agriculture and cities can overload coastal waters with excess nutrients, ships in ports and other waterways can mix up sediment and increase turbidity, and even air pollution can end up in our water.

As lockdown restrictions were put into place around the world in response to the novel coronavirus, the immediate reduction in vehicle and ship traffic led to noticeable improvements in our air quality. Now, researchers are looking to see if those same benefits will be reflected in our water.

Scientists are examining whether the amount of algae (chlorophyll-a) and sediment (turbidity) in water bodies was affected by the shutdowns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, teasing out those signals from normal variations due to weather and economic changes is challenging.

*Chlorophyll-a is an indicator of algae growth. During coronavirus-related shutdowns, changes in our activity may affect the amount of nutrients flowing into water bodies. This image shows the changes in chlorophyll-a for the San Francisco Bay Area on April 3, 2020. Redder colors indicate higher levels of chlorophyll-a and worse water quality. Bluer colors indicate lower levels of chlorophyll-a and improved water quality. Image Credit: NASA.*

### Scientific research

To determine the effect that COVID-19 lockdowns may have on global water quality, NASA is using satellite data and imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard the Aqua satellite and imagery from the NASA-U.S. Geological Survey Landsat satellites to look for changes in chlorophyll or turbidity.

New [research](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/rrnes-awards/) funded by NASAâ€™s Rapid Response and Novel research in the Earth Sciences (RRNES) program element is also using these data to explore changes in water quality resulting from the shutdowns.

### Interpreting the data

Both chlorophyll-a concentrations and turbidity fluctuate naturally based on a variety of factors, including natural geography and the weather. For example, in coastal areas strongly influenced by river runoff and human activities, such as shipping and tourism, higher chlorophyll-a concentration can result from the discharge of urban sewage and fertilizers from agriculture over the watershed, which could counter any effects we may have seen due to the shutdowns.

Therefore, these data must be interpreted cautiously before drawing conclusions on how COVID-19 shutdowns may have affected water quality.
