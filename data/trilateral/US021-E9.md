## International space agencies see fewer cars in pay parking area at Los Angeles International Airport during pandemic-related slowdown

On the indicator chart, for each day, the light/dark red chart background indicates whether there were **restrictions or lockdown** measure in place in the country where the city is located. This information is based on [Oxford University’s coronavirus government response tracker](https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/). 

Satellite imagery from three international space agencies has quantified the decline in traffic at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) since COVID-19 slowdowns began, specifically noting both the lower number of cars in the pay parking lot and the consistency of these numbers throughout the day.

As recently as April, imagery from NASA, JAXA and ESA showed significant fluctuations in the number of cars in the lot at different times of day. This pattern aligns with what would be expected with travelers flying at various times throughout the week and during the winter holidays. Since pandemic safety restrictions brought travel to a near-standstill, however, the consistency of parked cars indicates that fewer cars are moving in and out of the lots nearby the airport.

The report from LAX is part of an effort by NASA, JAXA and ESA to help quantify changes at airports and other transportation hubs around the world caused by lockdowns designed to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. Scientists are combining two kinds of space-based remote sensing data – synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from JAXA’s ALOS-2 and ESA’s Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites, with NASA-processed high-resolution optical remote sensing data from Planet’s SkySat. Planet provides data to NASA as part of the agency’s Commercial SmallSat Data Acquisition Program. 

Combining these datasets enables production of more comprehensive assessment of changes in patterns in the airport parking lots. While Planet imagery can be used to monitor changes in the number of cars in these lots and around the world every day, its camera like sensors cannot see through clouds, therefore limiting our ability to track changes on cloudy or rainy days. The radar systems on the Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2SAR satellites penetrate through clouds and rain, as well as making observations both during the day and at night. This capability makes it possible to track changes in activity, such as parking patterns, every time a SAR satellite is over the region – a few times a week.  The combined datasets make it possible to better track changes in human activity related to the COVID-19 than with a single satellite system.    

The time series trend graph of car density in the parking area at LAX shown in Figure 1 tracks the total number of cars during December 2019 and September 2020.

In April, as the effects of California’s earlier pandemic-related lockdowns were just taking hold, ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 recorded variations in the number of cars parked at LAX. This was largely due to the 6-hour time differences between observations between ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1. Sentinel-1 passes over LAX at 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. (PST), and ALOS-2 at noon and midnight (PST). Since then, however, the variation in the number of cars between observations for both satellites has stabilized, indicating both fewer cars overall and fewer cars leaving and entering the parking area.

Figure 2 shows a color composited SAR image of LAX from the PALSAR-2 instrument aboard the ALOS-2 satellite. The different colors in the image correspond to the different dates the images were captured. The blue/green area shows cars parked in the pay lots on Jan. 11, before the pandemic restrictions. Red areas indicate fewer cars parked there on May 30. White areas are buildings.

Figures 3 and 4 show car detection in red using Planet’s SkySat imagery and Artificial Intelligence (AI).  The first image shows a heavy concentration of cars in the parking lots in January, corresponding to the SARS image from ALOS-2. In the July image using Planet data, there are far fewer cars in the pay lots. The number of cars in the rental car lots remained high, indicating less demand for those vehicles.

Overall, Planet’s SkySat estimated 3,708 cars parked on Jan. 9, and 1,943 on July 8. This corresponds with SAR data from ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1.
