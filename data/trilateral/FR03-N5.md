## Port of Dunkirk (France) - Nightlights

The High Definition Nightlights dataset is processed to eliminate light sources
like moonlight reflectance and other interferences. The darker shades are places
with less light while the lighter shades of yellow are areas with more light.

The Port of Dunkirk is the third-largest maritime port in northern France. Located on the busy North Sea, the port is well known for the comings and goings of heavy cargo barges. In early March, following French government guidance, the port began to limit activity in response to the novel coronavirus. Researchers are using night lights to track variations in energy use, migration, and transportation at the port in response to social distancing and lockdown measures. They are able to visualize the extent social distancing measures impacted various economic activities based on whether light pollution increased or decreased, which highways were shut down, and which cities stayed the same.
