# COVID19 impact on Water Quality in Europe 


The water quality analysis focuses on assessing the effect of the lockdown and the subsequent economic recovery on inland and coastal water quality by monitoring the deviation from a climatological mean of Chlorophyll-a concentration over a number of key Areas of Interest.

#### The time series shows daily Chl-a concentration offshore the Venice lagoon (45.30 N, 12.50 E) as calculated from [CMEMS multi-mission](https://marine.copernicus.eu/services-portfolio/product-improvements/) 1km resolution product including and [MODIS-Aqua](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/aqua/), [VIIRS-NPP](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/download-nrt-data/viirs-nrt) and [Sentinel-3A-OLCI](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-olci) data:

* **<span style="color:green">Green dots</span>** show daily values lower than the climatological mean (in grey), indicating good water quality. 
* **<span style="color:blue">Blue dots</span>** show daily values greater than the climatological mean but still inside the climatological variability, indicating regular water quality. 
* **<span style="color:red">Red dots</span>** stand for values beyond the climatological variability, indicating poorer water quality. 

In accordance with the weekly mean anomaly maps of Chl concentration, the time series show **after the lockdown date (March, 11th) predominant presence of days recording good water quality and, in particular, a total absence of Red dots**.  

On the indicator chart, for each day, the light/dark red chart background indicates whether there were **restrictions or lockdown** measure in place in the country where the city is located. This information is based on [Oxford Universityâ€™s coronavirus government response tracker](https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/).

**Chlorophyll-a (Chl) concentration** is an indicator of algae abundance and productivity. In open ocean, it fluctuates naturally over space and time as a result of atmospheric (wind) and oceanic (currents) conditions. In coastal areas, strongly influenced by river inputs and human activities, higher concentration can also result from the discharge in coastal waters of urban sewage, industrial runoffs, and fertilizers from agriculture activities over the watershed.

Nutrient inputs of anthropogenic origin affect the natural amount of phytoplankton in marine and inland waters, representing a continuous threat to biodiversity and leading to undesirable modifications of phytoplankton concentration (i.e., eutrophication). By enabling to capture human pressures on coastal ecosystems and detect eutrophication, Chlorophyll-a concentration is therefore a commonly used proxy for water quality. 

Target areas are inland waters and coastal areas influenced by intense human activities (urban areas, heavy industry, aquaculture, agriculture, tourism). The indicators have been first developed for Italian coastal areas, such as North Adriatic (including the Venice Lagoon and the Po River Delta), Rome coastal area, and Gulf of Naples. The approach will then be extended to other European coasts (Lion Gulf in France, Barcelona coastal area in Spain).
