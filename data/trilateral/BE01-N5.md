## Port of Ghent (Belgium) - Nightlights

The High Definition Nightlights dataset is processed to eliminate light sources
like moonlight reflectance and other interferences. The darker shades are places
with less light while the lighter shades of yellow are areas with more light.

Located on the North Sea on the coast of Belgium, the Port of Ghent is a highly trafficked seaport. By focusing on changes in this typically bustling area, researchers are able to compare changes in nightlights, an indicator of economic activity before and after novel coronavirus lockdowns began.

Nightlight observations from space track variations in energy use, migration, and transportation. By comparing regions before and after guidelines to shelter-in-place began, researchers visualize the extent to which social distancing measures affected various economic activities based on whether light pollution increased or decreased, which highways were shut down, and which cities stayed the same.
