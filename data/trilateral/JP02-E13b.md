## Grounded airplanes during the novel coronavirus pandemic

Indicator provided by: [JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/) based on data provided by [JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/), [ESA](https://esa.int) and [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)

On the indicator chart, for each day, the light/dark red chart background indicates whether there were **restrictions or lockdown** measure in place in the country where the city is located. This information is based on [Oxford University’s coronavirus government response tracker](https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/). 

During COVID-19 related lockdowns, activities like air travel decreased to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. To help quantify these changes, scientists are combining two kinds of space-based remote sensing data – synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from JAXA’s ALOS-2 and ESA’s Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites with NASA-processed high-resolution optical remote sensing data from Planet Inc. – to observe and quantify the changes in grounded airplanes and air traffic around the world.

SAR is a high-resolution, space-based radar that makes 2D images out of 3D objects. By comparing SAR images of airports before, during, and after lockdowns, scientists can determine how air traffic may have changed during the pandemic. In general, manmade targets such as buildings, cars, and airplanes appear brighter in SAR imagery than natural targets like bare land, forested areas, or the ocean.

Figure 1 shows a color composited SAR image of Tokyo International Airport, Haneda from the PALSAR-2 instrument aboard the ALOS-2 satellite. The different colors in the image correspond to the different dates the images were captured: red images were captured before lockdowns on November 28, 2019, green images were captured as lockdowns began on March 19, 2020, and blue images were captured during lockdowns on May 14, 2020. White colored areas, such as buildings, indicate no changes during the time period, whereas individual red, green, or blue colored pixels in the parking areas of the airport indicate airplanes at that time. Cyan colored areas show airplanes on March and May 2020.

Figure 2 shows a time series animation of SAR images taken from Sentinel-1 at Tokyo International Airport, Haneda from January 10 to June 2, 2020. Brighter pixels in parking areas of the airport may correspond with airplanes at each acquisition date.

In addition to the SAR imagery, NASA scientists also used artificial intelligence technology and high-resolution optical imagery from Planet to detect and count aircraft on the ground at airports. Figure 3 shows the estimated result for May 17 at Tokyo International Airport, Haneda – the red rectangles show the AI-detected aircraft.

Combining high-resolution optical remote sensing data from Planet with SAR imagery from ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 is a powerful method to provide reliable time series data on the number of aircrafts grounded at airports over time. While Planet imagery is powerful tool to monitor changes in aircraft around the world every day, its sensors cannot penetrate clouds, limiting the detection capability on cloudy or rainy days. Alternatively, SAR data, while lower resolution, can penetrate clouds. Therefore, scientists are combining these datasets to get the most comprehensive images of changes at aircraft counts at airports during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Figure 4 shows the change in grounded planes at Haneda airport over time. The data show that the total number of grounded planes in April was two times more than it was in February. This corresponds with data from the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism (MLIT), which estimate that the total number of passengers in Haneda airport was down more than 60 percent in March and more than 90 percent in April compared to February. This means that far more planes were grounded due to declining passenger numbers.
