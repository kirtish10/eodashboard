## Water quality in Tokyo Bay

**Concentrations of chlorophyll-a**  which indicate an abundance of phytoplankton in ocean waters, are often used as an indicator of inland and coastal water quality. Measured by satellites that sense ocean color, the change percentage featured here helps to assess and monitor potential affects from coronavirus-related lockdowns â€“ and subsequent recovery.

Chlorophyll-a fluctuates naturally with nutrient, solar irradiance, water temperature, and related factors. In coastal areas, it is commonly used as a proxy for water quality because it is strongly influenced by river runoff and human activities, such as the discharge of urban sewage and agriculture fertilizers.

The chlorophyll-a indicator images in **Tokyo Bay** are an example of the coastal water-quality changes near the biggest Japanese cities of Tokyo, Yokohama, and Kawasaki.

Relatively large rivers - **Arakawa**, **Sumida**, **Edogawa**, and **Tama-River** - are to the north and west sides of the bay. The variation in chlorophyll-a indicators in late March to April 2020 were similar to other months, and it was sometimes more influenced by large river outflow such as around the end of March and middle-late April in 2020. That may indicate the coastal environment in the Tokyo Bay is not significantly affected by the reduced activities in the term, even though the imagery cannot detect phenomena smaller than several hundred-meters.

Another indicator, **Total Suspended Matter (TSM)** concentration, will be a help to understand the environmental changes, because the satellite Chl is sometimes influenced by other light-absorption components such as dissolved organic matter and the TSM shows more direct influence of the suspended-matter upwelling by the winds and the river outflow especially in the bay areas. 

Weekly anomaly of the TSM concentration map and time series are introduced in the dashboard. Similarly to the Chl, TSM did not show clear anomaly from late March to April 2020 except for some increase event due to the river outflow after the heavy rains. In the case of Tokyo Bay, the natural change seemed dominant for TSM rather than the low ship traffic.
