## Water Quality in San Francisco 

California officials issued a shelter-in-place order on March 19, 2020. As a result, much of the stateâ€™s population remained mostly at home from then through early June. Because of this, annual outputs of wastewater treatment plants may be affected, leading to changes in overall water quality in the San Francisco Bay. More time and rigorous scientific research are needed to determine what overall effect this will have on water quality. 

For example, remotely sensed chlorophyll-a measurements (an indicator of water nutrient levels and algae growth) over south San Francisco Bay, along with on-the-ground reports from the South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Program, indicate increased water quality during the shelter-in-place order. However, such effects may be obscured by less-than-normal rainfall in the spring coupled with high temperatures and cloudiness in the region, which naturally limit algae growth. Furthermore, unusual sediment distribution patterns in the main stem of the Bay are also likely attributed to natural variability. 

These maps are obtained from moderate-resolution imagers onboard the USGS/NASA Landsat 8 and ESA Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites. Further research is required to explore any linkages between human activities and natural climate variability in the region.
