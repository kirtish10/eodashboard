## Impact of COVID-19 on Water Quality

The effect of the lockdown and the subsequent recovery on inland and coastal waters was assessed by monitoring the deviation from a weekly climatological mean of chlorophyll-a (Chl) concentration and Total Suspended Matters (TSM) as measured from optical sensors onboard the three agency’s satellites, namely  **[Sentinel-3 (ESA)](http://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-3)**, **[GCOM-C (JAXA)](https://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/gcom_c/)** and **[Aqua (NASA)](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/aqua/)**.

Chlorophyll-a concentration is an indicator of algae abundance which fluctuates naturally over space and time, as a result of combined atmospheric and oceanic effects (e.g., marine currents and upwelling). In coastal areas, strongly influenced by river inputs and human activities, high Chl concentration can result from the discharge of urban sewage, industrial runoffs, and fertilizers from agriculture activities over watersheds. In particular, nutrient inputs of anthropogenic origin affect the natural amount of phytoplankton in marine and inland waters, representing a continuous threat to biodiversity and leading to undesirable modifications of phytoplankton concentration (i.e., eutrophication).

Total Suspended Matter (TSM) i.e, the concentration of organic and inorganic materials suspended in the water, is another proxy for water quality as different contaminants, including nutrients, trace metals, semi-volatile organic compounds, and numerous pesticides, can aggregate to these solids and brought in suspension. This can alter the state of the aquatic ecosystem and the use of freshwater resources. For instance, excessive suspended material might condition primary productivity. TSM concentration can be very high near the coasts due to the resuspension of terrestrial or submarine particulate matter by tides, waves, and currents.


### Water Quality Maps

The displayed maps show weekly Chl concentration anomalies (%) and weekly Total Suspended Matter concentration anomalies (%) for the North Adriatic Sea, the Mediterranean sub-basin most influenced by river runoff, in particular by the Po River, which is the largest river in Italy and which runs along many different industrialized areas. Moreover, the North Adriatic coastline is a very popular tourist destination. In particular, the displayed area includes Venice, one of the most touristic destinations in the world, whose frequentation totally stopped during the lockdown.

### Example of the impact of COVID-19 on Water Quality

Despite existing differences in spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution of the three optical sensors, as well as in the algorithms used to calculate the Chl concentration, all three sensors highlight a general, negative trend of Chl concentration anomaly in the Venice Lagoon as well as offshore the whole Po River coastal zone during the Italian lockdown.
In the Venice lagoon, this pattern of low Chlorophyll concentration can be most probably linked to the decrease of maritime traffic and tourism frequentation, as highlighted by high resolution Sentinel-2 images available in the area (Fig. 1).

Offshore the lagoon, this striking negative trend is likely due to remarkably well-stratified thermohaline conditions, which maintained values of Chl concentration fairy low and hindered alongshore transport of riverine loads in the northern sector of the basin. These well-stratified conditions, clearly exemplified by the observed increase in Sea Surface Temperature (Fig. 2) as measured by a multi-sensor product (including data from NOAA-18, MetOpA-B, Aqua, Terra, MSG1, NPP, Meteosat11, Sentinel 3A-B), resulted from the particular interplay between low and warm Po River runoff and low wind intensities.

However, despite the clear role of natural environmental factors, we cannot exclude a mutual role of a decrease in human activities over the Po River watershed, which enhanced the negative anomaly in Chl concentration, as highlighted by the low turbidity values in the lower branch of Po River, measured by Sentinel-2 during the lockdown phase (Fig. 3).
